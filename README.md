#### What the program does

Our program takes the user's name and favorite color and prints a sentence depending on what color the user inputted.
Our program also asks for your name, your age, and then prints out a message saying hi and your age.

#### How to use it

To use the program, you need to install and setup JupyterLab and start a terminal. Copy the link to the GitHub Repository and run the command "git clone https://github.com/ryankusmierz/Week-6-Lab-Exercise.git". This will download a folder to your local machine with the program and all necessary files. Navigate to Week-6-Lab-Exercise.ipynb. To use the program, run the code blocks in this file by pressing Shift+Enter. Be sure to read and follow the instructions in the "CODE-OF-CONDUCT.md" file before making changes to the program.

#### How to contribute

To contribute to this program, you can fork our code by pressing "Fork". Then follow our instructions on how to use the program to run and test your changes. Once you are done, you can use your program or save changes to our repository by sending a pull request on GitHub. This will send us a notification that you have made changes to our program and we can decide whether or not to update our program with these changes. Thank you for all the help you can give!

#### Miscellany

I chose the Apache license because it allows the user to freely use our program for any purpose, such as distributing it or modifying it, without any concerns.

I chose the Contributor Covenant code of conduct because it is very thorough and I believe all of the rules are fair, but at the same time strict enough to make our program a welcoming and positive thing that people can modify without any concerns of discrimination.
